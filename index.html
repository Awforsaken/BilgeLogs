                    <h2><em>Entry from personal journal of Walt "Patchwork" Dempsey</em><br>04:11:43 13-09-3013</h2>
                    <p>They didn’t tell us much. Just that we’d be free, and that there was some profit to be made from this ambergris... thing. The Leviathan, they called it. A creature so big it could swallow moons. The kind of thing you can’t even imagine until you’re right in front of it. And yet, here we are, heading straight for it. What choice do we have? No one gets out of the penal block without a price.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Marrow Rat? It’s a joke. Looks like it’ll fall apart the moment we hit a bump. I swear, the only thing holding it together is duct tape and bad luck. We’re no better. All six of us packed into this tin can, all of us just a little too broken for anything else.</p>
                    
                    <p>If I don’t make it out alive, maybe this will help whoever finds this make sense of what happened. Here is a rundown of our "crew".</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Darla Kowalski</strong> Codename: Sledge, Crew Leader, is the one everyone looks to. She's got that “don’t mess with me” vibe, and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little terrified of her. Not that I’ll admit it, of course. She runs a tight ship, but there's something in her eyes that I can’t shake. Something like... guilt? Or maybe it’s just the way she handles the pressure. I don’t know. But when things go south, I’m glad she’s the one in charge.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Viktor Iliev</strong> Codename: Doc, Medic, is... well, a little unsettling. He’s like a surgeon who’s too calm about the whole “cutting into people” thing. I don’t think he’s afraid of blood, or what’s inside us, or whatever we’re up against in the belly of this thing. He just does what needs to be done. Doesn't flinch. Doesn’t say much, but when he does? It’s usually something dark.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Kurt Hansen</strong> Codename: Breaker, Muscle I think? Now, he’s something else. Big guy. If you catch him when he's not doing muscle work, he’s got this... optimism. Like he really believes we’re gonna get out of here alive. He hums to himself, talks about his childhood on some mining colony like it's a different lifetime. It's infectious, though, I’ll give him that. I’m not sure I believe it, but I’m sure as hell not going to stop him from trying to pull us through.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Maeve Sullivan</strong> Codename: Lights, Lamp Operator/Tracker, she’s the quiet one. Doesn’t speak much, just moves in and out of the shadows, always keeping an eye on things. Handles the lamps, makes sure we’re not swallowed whole by the darkness. I respect her for that. But she’s got this calm about her that makes me think maybe she knows more than she lets on.</p>
                    
                    <p>And then there’s me. <strong>Walt Dempsey</strong> Codename: Patchwork an Engineer/Technician. I keep this ship together, at least when it doesn’t fall apart completely. I used to be better at this. I swear, I used to know what I was doing. Now? Now I just patch holes and talk to myself. If I talk loud enough, maybe I won’t think about... well, what happened. Maybe I won’t think about the accident, the one that cost me everything. But that’s not why I’m here, is it? No, it’s to keep this wreck from sinking, just like the rest of us.</p>
